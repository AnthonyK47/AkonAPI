## Week 6 Updates 6/29/2025

- What did you do last week?
  - Last week was focused on studying for my exam for my other class and finishing up a lab, so I'm a bit behind, but I did begin researching rest API's by working through a handful of articles and videos.
- What do you plan to do this week?
  - My goal this week is to dive a little deeper into Rest API's and see how I can begin coding a pull request that would pull data from my work demo site.
- Are there any impediments in your way?
  - Holiday! I'm leaving on the 3rd and won't be back until the 6th, so it may not be practical to get a ton of work done, but I plan to do my best!
- Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
  - Not much to change here, my new goal is to try and microdose a lot of this information I'm learning each day. Even if it's just a half hour of work at some point during the day.

## Week 7 Updates 7/6/2025

- What did you do last week?
  - Started watching some videos on API and began reading a text book "Coding Clean, Reliable, and Safe REST APIs" to familiarize myself with HTTP and the types of requests I'll be testing. I'm not fully through chapter 1, but I'm just over halfway.
- What do you plan to do this week?
  - Work through chapter 1, and skim chapter 2 and 3 of the book.
- Are there any impediments in your way?
  - Nothing this next week!
- Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
  - No holiday's next week so I should have more time to work on the project.
